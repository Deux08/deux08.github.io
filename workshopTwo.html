                            <hr style="width:80%">
                            <p>I found this game through an instagram ad and chose it because it looks really interesting to me. The game is about pushing the people coming after you off the edge of the stage with a huge weapon that is placed in front of you in order to win. If the enemy hits you from behind, you get knocked away. Therefore, increasing the risk of falling of the platform. As i progress further into the game, it gets far more challenging due to the increasing number and types of enemies.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The game play is simple since only one finger is required. To move the character, all you have to do is press down with one finger and move it around. You can let go of your finger if you want your weapon to extend frontwards and back like a spring to push enemies away. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Since the challenge increases when u level up, i find this game very addicting. The fun part of this game is pushing enemies of the platform, what's not fun about it is the amount of advertisements that always pop up mid-game. In addition, the fact that you have to let go when you want to use the ejection feature, makes you forced to keep pressing the screen down if you dont want to use it</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The game can be greatly improved by reducing the amount of advertisements, adding more weapons, allowing the user's character to be customized and an extra button for the ejection feature.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-center">Penguin Isle</h2>
                            <hr style="width:80%">
                            <p>I found this game while i was randomly scrolling through the play store, and decided to download it since it gave me  quite a chill vibe when i was looking through the images of the game. This game is about building and expanding your own island of penguins, by purchasing new habitats. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Penguins work in those habitats to generate an income for you, and the money you get can be spent on improving habitats, expanding your island or hatching new penguins. Buying a new habitat takes a while, since it is being sold at a high price. Therefore, habitats must be upgraded and more penguins should be bought.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Progressing through the game is quite challenging, this is what makes it very addicting. The relaxing vibe it gives (due to good-graphics with a great color combination and relaxing music) and the cute in-game creatures makes the gameplay more interesting. The only thing that is not fun is the overpriced habitats, and one way to get lots of money is to watch ads. You basically can't progress quickly if you don't watch the ads.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The game can be improved by adding more characters that has perks which can boost the island development. On top of that it would be better if the price of expanding the island is reduced so that we won't have to watch a ton of ads in order to get money quickly.</p>
